	This is the README for a Scheme Interpreter written in Common Lisp. 
	The interpreter is only for educational purposes and does not have full 
	compatibility with the Scheme standard as defined in R6RS.

	Installation:

	In order to run the interpreter a Common Lisp implemenation is needed,
	specifically GNU CLISP. Clisp is available for Unix based systems
	including GNU/Linux. <clisp.org>

	In order to use the interpreter download the source file and
	on the terminal run:
	
	clisp -i Scheme.lisp
	
	Once the interpreter is running, call the read-eval-print loop (REPL)
	 with:

	(revalp)

	Now the Scheme interpreter is running. 
	
	Documentation:
	
	The interpreter supports most Scheme expressions, 
	but does not yet have a working macro system.
	Additionally not all of the built-in Scheme procedures are defined.
	The idea was to keep the interpreter as minimal as possible.
	The user can either define their own or modify the source as needed. 
	
	List of some of the built in functions:

		*
		/
		list
		car 
		cons 
		cdr
		=
		>
		<
		>=
		<=
		equal
		and 
		or
